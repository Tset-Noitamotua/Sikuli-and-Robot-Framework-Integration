Originally this were the source files for MykhailoÂ´s blogpost
on blog.mykhailo.com. (see readme backup below)

The files were updated in this repo to make them work with
Sikulix 1.1.0 (nightly build 2014-11-09) on Windows 8.1.

System Configuration Setup:
- Windows 8.1 (German)
- Java version 1.8.0_05 (build 1.8.0_05-b13)
- Sikulix 1.1.0 (nightly build 2014-11-09)
- Robot Framework 2.8.6
- Python 2.7.3
- Jython 2.5.3

Optional:
IntelliJ IDEA 14.0.2 with Python plugin and
Jython as project SDK + sikulixapi.jar and
Lib folder from Sikulix installation (C:\sikulix\Lib)
as external libraries for the project to have
syntax highlighting and code completion for both
Sikulix and Python
