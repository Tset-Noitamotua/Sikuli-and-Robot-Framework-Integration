HELP PLEASE:    Still searching for a way to get code assistance for Jython in Vim / gVim.
                e.g. code completion, syntax highlighting and analysis etc.
                If you have an idea - please share!!!

NOTE: This is a work in progress! Some things might not work as intended out of the box.
Use this at your on risk!

Originally this were the source files for MykhailoÂ´s blogpost
on blog.mykhailo.com. (see readme backup below)

The files were updated in this repo to make them work with
SikuliX 1.1.0 (nightly build 2015-01-16) on Windows 8.1.
(Actually last update was done on Windows 7! And holy shit!!
It works on Win 7 without having to change the screenshots!
But I still have to run tests on Win 8)

System Configuration Setup:
- Windows 8.1 (German - but I plan to change that to English soon)
- Java version 1.8.0_05 (build 1.8.0_05-b13)
- SikuliX 1.1.0 (nightly build 2015-01-16)
- Robot Framework 2.8.7
- Python 2.7.3
- Jython 2.7 beta3 (Jython 2.7b3)

Optional (for code assistance purpose):
IntelliJ IDEA 14.0.2 with Python plugin and
Jython as project SDK + sikulixapi.jar and
Lib folder from Sikulix installation (~your_path_to_sikulix~\Lib
or ~your_path_to_sikulix~\sikulixapi.jar\Lib) as external libraries
for the project to have syntax highlighting and
code completion for both SikuliX and Python.

Cheers
