Sikuli and Robot Framework Integration Project
==============================================

Originally this were the source files for MykhailoÂ´s blogpost
on blog.mykhailo.com. (see readme backup below)

The files were updated in this repo to make them work with
SikuliX 1.1.0 (nightly build 2015-01-16) on Windows 8.1.

System Configuration Setup:
- Windows 8.1 (German - but I plan to change that to English soon)
- Java version 1.8.0_05 (build 1.8.0_05-b13)
- SikuliX 1.1.0 (nightly build 2015-01-16)
- Robot Framework 2.8.6
- Python 2.7.3
- Jython 2.7 beta3 (Jython 2.7b3)

Optional (for code assistance purpose):
IntelliJ IDEA 14.0.2 with Python plugin and
Jython as project SDK + sikulixapi.jar and
Lib folder from Sikulix installation (C:\sikulix\Lib
or C:\sikulix\sikulixapi.jar\Lib) as external libraries
for the project to have syntax highlighting and
code completion for both SikuliX and Python.
